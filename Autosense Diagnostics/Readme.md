**Project Overview**  
As of today, reactive maintenance still dominates vehicle servicing. The problem with this is that it leads to avoidable downtime, higher repair costs, and higher emissions. Using AI and analytics, we propose transitioning towards a more proactive way of dealing with car faults by continuously monitoring insights from IoT sensors. The AI will then predict faults based on the readings and design maintenance schedules, repair suggestions, and preventative measures.  
The model aims to classify engine faults from sensor data to recommend maintenance action. It makes use of multiple analytics features, from fault detection, scheduling, cost prediction, and insight delivery, to create value for drivers, fleet managers, and manufacturers. This approach extends the existing EngineFaultDB methodology (Vergara et al., 2023) by developing a new machine learning pipeline that makes use of real-world data.  
The business problem was formulated using a multi-class classification model. The model predicts four classes of engine condition based on continuous readings of manifold pressure, throttle position, RPM, emissions, and fuel consumption. The model’s output will then be fed into a pipeline that involves a series of tasks that support the AI’s initiative of creating maintenance schedules and repair decision-making. For this prototype, class 0 refers to a healthy engine, while the rest refer to the following engine issues:

**Dataset**  
The study uses the EngineFaultDB dataset that has 55,999 records and 14 continuous predictors that represent the performance of a C14NE engine. This sensor data was collected under normal conditions and fault-induced conditions in order to include engines with actual faults in their dataset.
