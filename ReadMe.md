**Overview**  
This project is comprised of two parts:  
1. Cluster Analysis - A cluster analysis to create profile segments based on the buying habits of the customers of each store. This will give us insight into the behaviour of each store’s general market.  
2. Market Basket Analysis and Association Rules - The goal of this type of analysis is to analyse the probability of a consumer buying an item if he or she bought an antecedent item, giving us a chance of coming up with up-selling techniques.
