**Overview**  
This project is comprised of two parts:  
1. Cluster Analysis - A cluster analysis to create profile segments based on the buying habits of the customers of each store. This will give us insight into the behaviour of each store’s general market.  
2. Market Basket Analysis and Association Rules - The goal of this type of analysis is to analyse the probability of a consumer buying an item if he or she bought an antecedent item, giving us a chance of coming up with up-selling techniques.  

This project uses SAS Enterprise Miner to analyse retail purchasing behaviour across 689 stores. The goal was to segment customers into meaningful groups using clustering techniques and identify high-value product associations using market basket analysis. These insights support data-driven decisions around product bundling, store layout, pricing strategy, and targeted marketing.
